      "reviewText": "You can't beat the price for this kit and it's so easy to start seeds. I used this for the first time last year and followed planting and disk instructions and had over a 75% germination rate! Between the cost and ease-of-use, this is a great way to start seeds for outdoors. Just keep the little pellets moist and you'll be good to go.Some seeds need dark to germinate, so make sure to read your seed packets!",

But I was wrong! My granddaughter and I did the first tray together. She poured the water, then I counted out the seeds for her to plant. Her Mom and I did the second tray after she got bored. Within three days the first of the plants were up. It has now been 8 days and nearly every pellet has seedlings. I have already had to move the first ones (cantaloupe) to a large peat pot since they are five inches tall! I am using one of the top covers under the four large peat pots.Almost all of the others are 2 inches tall, but still fragile.This will be my first garden grown completely from seed, and I will definitely use this again next year!Edited, All of the plants are in the ground and doing well! Tomatoes are sprawling all over the place, Zucchini have flowers, even the cantaloupe are starting to perk up now that the weather is warmer.",

      "reviewText": "This is my second germination set I've ordered in the last two weeks.  This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms.  However, the concept works:  place peat pots of seeds in a warm, humid environment and seeds will sprout.  I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp.  The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well, as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper, though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout.",

      "reviewText": "I've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it's supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn't been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don't seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the \"Jiffy 5777\" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you're using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I'd expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years' use out them. This works better sometimes than others.In summary, I've used this product for a couple years now, and it's definitely become my favorite method for most plants. I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it's available--just be warned about refill sizes, and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you're hoping to re-use it for the next season.",
